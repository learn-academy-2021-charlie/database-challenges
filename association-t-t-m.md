-rails g model CreditCard number:integer expiration:string credit_id:integer

Challenges
Create three owners and save them in the database
Owner.create name:'name' address:'adress' x3


FIXED ERROR
change column name.
-rails g migrastion rename_credit_id_to_owner_id
--> go inside the class file
--> rename_column :tablename, :oldcolumnname, :newcolumnname
--> rails db:migrate

<!-- Create a credit card in the database for each owner -->
mr_bob = Owner.first
mr_bob.credit_cards.create number:12345, expiration:'March 2025'
x3


<!-- Add two more credit cards to one of the owners  -->
mr_bob.credit_cards.create "" x2

<!-- Stretch Challenge
Add a credit limit to each card -->
--> rails g migration add_columns_to_credit_Cards
--> inside class file
--> add_column :credit_cards, :credit_limit, :integer
--limit = CreditCard.all

<!-- Find the total credit extended to the owner with multiple credit cards -->

mr_bobs_credit = CreditCard.where owner_id:1

mr_bobs_credit.sum( :credit_limit)ÃŸ
